# Texture 3D Converter

## Quickstart

Copy the script within the Editor folder to your Unity project. Make sure it ends up within an Editor folder, so it will be only used for the Editor and not for builds.

A new item in the menu bar will appear under "Tools -> Texture 3D Converter".

Then fill the form:

1. Select the texture which contains the grid of 3D Sprites
2. Set number of rows and columns
3. If the grid isn't fully filled, adjust the tile number
4. Set resolution of the resulting 3D Texture (take care, can become huge quickly)

On pressing the "Make Texture3D" button, the new asset should appear next to the chosen texture.
